# Capstone Project: Web Store

## Description

This application is an online store for a female-targeted sporting equipment store. It aims to bridge the gap between the more "macho" and masculine stereotypical aesthetics commonly seen in the field of sports, and the more graceful and hyper-feminine style that a lot of women seek after - allowing them to make the game that they love their own, expressing their femininity throughout.

The app itself offers a range of sporting equipment with a more feminine aesthetic, from a variety of international brands, all curated into one location for the convinience of its users. It allows users to log in, and sort through this variety of products in order to choose which ones best suit them.

## Features

- Cart Features: Users can add whichever products they choose to their cart, simply by clicking the "add to cart" button. Once added to the cart, the price of an item is immediately added to the total price off all items in the cart, allowing the user to keep track of their total. The user also is given the option to remove an item from the cart, or clear the cart entirely. From the Cart Page, the user can go to the checkout page, and choose their preferred method of shipment - with a helpful "Help" feature provided in order to give extra information on each item in the cart
- Store features: Users can sort through the multiple products in the store, and choose between the various product option provided by the store. They are able to see the product name, price, and a preview of what the product looks like. When theyve made their decision, they can press the "Add to cart" button, and that item is moved straight to the users cart
- Account features: Upon reaching the Landing page, the user is given the option to either log in, or register for an account. Should the user log in, they need to enter their account user name, before they will immediately be taken to the landing page, where a welcome message will be displayed on the nav-bar with their username, as well as the option to logout. However if they need to register, they will be recquired to enter their name, surname, username, email and password, before being taken to the landing page, where a welcome message will be displayed on the nav-bar with their username, as well as the option to logout.
